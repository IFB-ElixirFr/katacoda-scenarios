## Error stream and its redirection

Icone Vocabulary : we previously introduced standard input and standard output. 
Input and Output of an Unix command are also named streams. Changing their default values (keyboard and screen) is called redirection.
In addition to standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout), a third stream exists and is named standard error (**stderr**)

By default, **stderr** is set to the screen. It can contain errors but also warnings and logs, depending on the command and parameters. 

The following command generates an error (the search for a word in a file is correct but not in a directory):
```bash
grep sur un nom de répertoire au lieu d’un nom de fichier.
```
The stderr stream can be empty if the Unix command runs without error.

As previously mentioned for stdin and stdout, it is also possible to redirect **stderr** to a file using the `2>` operator.

```bash
remettre l’ex. ci-dessus et rediriger l’erreur dans un fichier avec 2>
```

In case you want to redirect stdout and stderr in separate files, you can use both operators `1>` and `2>`

```bash
ex. commande toto 1> toto_out 2> toto.log
```
If you want to redirect both stdout and stderr in a common file you can use “&>”.
```bash
ex. commande toto &> toto.log
```
