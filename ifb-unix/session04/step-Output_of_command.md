## Output of an Unix command

By default, as you have seen so far, the result of an Unix command is printed on screen.

Example :
'''
$ grep...
'''
result of the command grep is printed on the screen

Icone “Vocabulary” : the standard output of a command is named stdout

By default, stdout is set to screen print. But you can change this behavior and print stdout to a file. 
You must use the “1>” operator to do this or more simply, “>”.

ex. reprise du grep précédent avec >
