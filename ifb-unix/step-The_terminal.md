The command line interface (or Operating System “Shell”) can be accessed through the terminal. The terminal will behave as a command interpreter that will translate the commands in order to call associated programs that will be used by the system to perform specific tasks (e.g. reading, copying or removing a file). There are thus a certain number of commands that one needs to learn in order to be able to communicate with the computer. 
The terminal most generally appears as a simple windowed application that displays a line of  characters called prompt in the upper left corner. 
Although this may differ based on configuration, the prompt will frequently contain the login, the name of the computer and the path to the current working directory.
Here is a classic prompt you can have on a regular Linux server:

```
[cnorris@clust-slurm-client ~]$ 
```

In this case, the login is `cnorris`, the server name is `clust-slurm-client` and the `~` is the current directory.
Note that in this course, only the prompt,`$`, is displayed.

There are several shells that can be used to interact with the terminal (e.g. bash, bsh, ksh, csh, zsh,...). They can be considered as dialects and their syntaxes are very close. The most popular language is Bash which is the default OS Shell on numerous Linux systems (bash will be used here).
