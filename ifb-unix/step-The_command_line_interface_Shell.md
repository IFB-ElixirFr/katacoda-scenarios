The CLI is a very powerful tool that has become a method of choice in the bioinformatics field for several reasons. 

Indeed, as commands are written using a specific shell (e.g. most generally Bash), they can be stored for traceability, reproducibility or automation purposes.

The richness of the language allows one to perform highly complex tasks including accessing locally or distantly shared data (e.g. files, databases...), working with computing clusters using job queues and having a fine grained control of processes and computational resources

The drawback is that one needs to learn a new language in order to benefit from all these features.
