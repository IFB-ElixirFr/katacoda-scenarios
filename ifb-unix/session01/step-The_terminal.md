We have already mentioned that the Shell lived in a dedicated interface: **the terminal**.

The terminal generally appears as a simple windowed application. Look at the terminal on the right window. 
It is a black frame displaying a **prompt** that usually ends by a `$` sign. 
Just after this prompt you will have to type commands.

Several shells can be used to interact within the terminal (e.g. `bash`, `ksh`, `csh`, `zsh`, ...). 
The most popular shell is Bash which is the default OS Shell on most Linux systems. 
In this course the Bash shell will be used.
