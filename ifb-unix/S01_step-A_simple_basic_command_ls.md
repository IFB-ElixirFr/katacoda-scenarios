A basic but very useful command is `ls`, that’s list content of a directory.
Try to type `ls` and then press <kbd>enter</kbd> on your Linux terminal on the right.

The word `Data` should be printed out. This `Data` here is a directory that we will explore later.

Now, type the following command in your terminal :
`ls -l Data`

Remarks : Pay attention to the space character between `ls`  and `-l`  and between `-l` and Data

ls is the command we already introduced
`-l` is an option to modify the behaviour of the ls instruction. Options start with a dash (`-`).
Data is the argument provided to the instruction.

The above command means that we want to print with details (option `-l`) the content of the directory (Data) provided as an argument.
