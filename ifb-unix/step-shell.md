Instructing a computer to perform a particular task can be done through two ways. The graphical user interface (GUI) controlled through a mouse or using keyboard shortcuts has been popularized since the advent of the operating systems for personal computers. Command line interface (CLI) is an alternative solution which allows users to send computer instructions using a dedicated language. 

## The command line interface

The CLI is a very powerful tool that has become a method of choice in the bioinformatics field for several reasons. Indeed, as commands are written using a specific language (e.g. most generally Bash), they can be stored for traceability, reproducibility or automation purposes. The richness of the language allows one to perform highly complex tasks including accessing locally or distantly shared data (e.g. files, databases...), working with computing clusters using job queues and having a fine grained control of processes and computational resources. The drawback is that one needs to learn a new language in order to benefit from all these features.

## The terminal

The command line interface (or OS “Shell”) can be accessed through the terminal. The terminal will behave as a command interpreter that will translate the commands in order to call associated programs that will be used by the system to perform specific tasks (e.g. reading, copying or removing a file). There are thus a certain number of commands that one needs to learn in order to be able to communicate with the computer. 

The terminal most generally appears as a simple windowed application that displays a line of characters called prompt in the upper left corner. Although this may differ based on configuration, the prompt will frequently contain the login, the name of the computer and the path to the current working directory (in the temrinal example the prompt is the single letter **$**). 

## The shell

There are several languages that can be used to interact with the terminal (e.g. bash, bsh, ksh, csh, zsh,...). They can be considered as dialects  and their syntaxes are very close. The most popular language is Bash which is the default OS Shell on numerous Linux systems (bash will be used here).
